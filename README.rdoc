= CSS3 Buttons

This is a collection of buttons that show what is possible using CSS3 and other advanced techniques, while maintaining the simplest possible markup. These buttons look best in Chrome and Safari (especially on OSX). They look almost as good in Firefox, with all other browsers falling back to a less-styled button.

Some of these buttons are using the Iconic icon set by P.J. Onori, via the method described here: http://somerandomdude.com/articles/design-technology/font-embedding-icons

If you use any of these buttons in the wild, drop me a note and let me know.
