# CSS3 Buttons

This is a collection of buttons that show what is possible using CSS3 and other advanced techniques, while maintaining the simplest possible markup. These buttons look best in Chrome and Safari (especially on OSX). They look almost as good in Firefox, with all other browsers falling back to a less-styled button.

These buttons are now implemented using Sass, using [Bourbon](http://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon). The plain, generated CSS for all the buttons is also still available in its previous location within the repo.

If you'd like to modify the repo locally, you'll need to watch the Sass directory with the follow command:

    sass --watch stylesheets/scss:stylesheets -r ./stylesheets/scss/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb
